Probabilistic Model for Wildfire Spread
==============

Probabilistically models the spread of a wildfire throughout a dense forest and displays the progression graphically. Probabilities of a tree igniting or dying are drawn from a customizable distribution.

Based on the _Stochastic cellular automata model for wildland fire spread dynamics_ described by Almeida and Macau here:

Additional complicatons such as wind and probabilities that vary per tree were added by me.
