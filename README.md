wildfire_model
==============

Probabilistically models the spread of a wildfire throughout a forest and displays the progression graphically. Probabilities of a tree igniting or dying are drawn from a customizable distribution.

Based on the model described by Almeida and Macau here: http://iopscience.iop.org/1742-6596/285/1/012038/pdf/1742-6596_285_1_012038.pdf
Additional complicatons such as wind and probabilities that vary per tree were added by me.
